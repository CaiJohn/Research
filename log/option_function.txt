This log keep track of the development of the 'optional function'

//updated 2015.3.10
Requirement: the flag of hip/sleek can be written at the top of the target file.

With syntax like #option --ato -prelude "prelude_aux.ss"

There could be a flag to control this process, --iflag, which means inner flags are taken into consideration. When there are conflicts, inner flags will have lower priority.

Then the file will be opened twice. 

I added a new parse function name parse_hip_with_option, which will take "##OPTION args" first.

args is then sent to main function, where the arguments are set.

But now there are still some problem when a flag has argument. It is working well -prelude, but have some problem with -dre. The reason may be that the debug file is set before the parsing happens.
